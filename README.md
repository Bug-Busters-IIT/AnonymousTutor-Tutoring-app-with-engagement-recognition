***SDGP PROJECT- Bug Busters- SE 20***

We are team Bug Busters, comprising five second year students following BEng(Hons) Software Engineering at the Informatics Institute of Technology affiliated with University of Westminster, UK. 

In general, a majority of students need an extra support in the subjects they learn. It is also visible that a set of Individuals who are willing to support students as tutors, lack a specific platform for getting interacted with students. As the student engagement in an online platform is comparatively low, apparently a system which connects students and tutors seems needy. As a result, we planned to create a web application for an online tutoring platform which fulfills the need of identifying student engagement realtime.

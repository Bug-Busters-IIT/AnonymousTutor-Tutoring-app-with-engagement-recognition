SDGP PROJECT

We are team Bug Busters, comprising five second year students following BEng(Hons) Software Engineering at the Informatics Institute of Technology affiliated with University of Westminster, UK. Currently, we are working on the second year group project and we are grateful to have your contribution regarding the statistical data gathering of our project.

In general, a majority of students need an extra support in the subjects they learn. It is also visible that a set of Individuals who are willing to support students as tutors, lack a specific platform for getting interacted with students. As the student engagement in an online platform is comparatively low, apparently a system which connects students and tutors seems needy. As a result, we planned to create a web application for an online tutoring platform which fulfills the need of identifying student engagement.
